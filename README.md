# Baseball_Stuff
Project to analyze baseball batting and pitching data from the 2023 MLB season.

# Summary

Batters:

I first filtered the data to only include players who had at least 100 at-bats as to not skew the data with batters who had very limited appearences in the Major Leagues this past season.

I then created a summary table that gave the means in the following stastical categories for each team this past seaso:
    - Hits
    - Homeruns
    - RBI's
    - Stolen Bases
    - Caught Stealing
    - Bases on Balls (Walks)
    - Strikeouts
    - Batting Average
    - On Base Percentage (OBP)
    - Slugging Percentage (SLG)
    - On Base Plus Slugging (OPS)

I then created visulizations that displayed Homeruns, RBI's, Strike Outs, Batting Average, and OPS.
